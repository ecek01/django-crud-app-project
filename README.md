## **Timeframe & Working Team**

- **Timeframe**: 2 weeks
- **Team**: Solo project

## **Technologies Used**

- **Back End**: Django, Python, PostgreSQL
- **Front End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Django ORM, FullCalendar.js

## **Brief**

<p>The goal of this project was to build a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application where users can manage their personal events, tasks, and to-dos within a calendar interface. Users should be able to: Register and login, create events with details, edit or delete events, filter and view upcoming tasks and logout.</p>

## **Planning**

- Wireframes were designed to plan the user interface, focusing on a clean and intuitive layout.
- User stories and application flow were mapped to ensure all CRUD operations were implemented.
- Database schema was structured using Django models and migrations.

## **Build/Code Process**

1. **Database Setup**: Configured PostgreSQL as the database using Django's ORM.

2. **Authentication**: Implemented user registration, login, and logout using Django's built-in authentication.

3. **CRUD Functionality**: Created models and views for managing events and tasks.

4. **Front-End Design**: Styled with Bootstrap and FullCalendar.js for an interactive calendar experience.

5. **Logout Redirection**: Ensured users are redirected to the home page after logout instead of Djangoâ€™s default.


## **Attributions**

- FullCalendar.js - Interactive event calendar.
- Bootstrap - Used for styling and responsive UI.

## **Challenges**

- Fixing logout redirection: By default, Django redirects to /accounts/profile/. This was fixed by setting LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "event_list" in settings.py
- Integrating FullCalendar.js with Django: Ensuring event data was dynamically loaded from the database into the front-end calendar.

## **Wins**

- Successfully implemented full CRUD functionality for events.
- Integrated authentication to personalize event management for different users.
- Created a modern and responsive UI using Bootstrap.

## **Key Learnings/Takeaways**

- Improved Django skills: Learned to structure Django projects efficiently.
- Gained experience with PostgreSQL and Django ORM for database management.
- Improved front-end integration: Worked with FullCalendar.js to enhance user experience.

## **Bugs**

- Logout issues: Fixed redirection errors by manually setting a logout redirect.
- Event display bugs: Some events were not appearing correctly due to incorrect date formatting.


## **Future Improvements**

- Enhance mobile responsiveness</li>
- Add event categories with colour-coding.</li>
- Enable event reminders via email notifications.
